"2 In general, scientific geography courses, statistical courses, and studio/performance courses in fine arts, music, and theatre will not satisfy this requirement. Courses that teach language skills are not acceptable. See Complementary Studies Courses. Students in the  Manufacturing Program will normally take their humanitites  elective in their 4th year.",3  Students pursuing the Civil Program will take APSC 253 Fluid Mechanics I and APSC 261 Theory of Structures. Students pursuing the Electrical Program will take APSC 255 Electric Circuits and Power and APSC 262 Digital Systems Design. Students Pursuing the Mechanical Program will take APSC 253 Fluid Mechanics I and APSC 255 Electric Circuits and Power.
