"2 Students who attain a sessional average between 50% and 54.9% will be placed on Academic Probation (ACPR). This will be noted on their academic record. Once a standing of ACPR has been placed on a student’s academic record, the student is permitted to continue in their degree program, but will be placed on a reduced maximum credit load for the following Winter and subsequent Summer Sessions, as follows:    ACPR Standing   Registration Winter Session Summer Session     Maximum   credit load per Session 24 9   Maximum   credit load per Term 12 6 (Term 1); 3 (Term 2)    If, upon completion of continuation evaluation the following year, the student’s Winter Session sessional average again falls in the 50%-54.9% range, they will remain on Academic Probation. If their Winter Session sessional average rises to 55% or more, they will clear Academic Probation and regain Good Standing. There is no maximum number of instances of Academic Probation permitted; students may remain on Academic Probation for the duration of their studies, as long as their Winter Session average falls in the ACPR range.",Maximum   credit load per Session
