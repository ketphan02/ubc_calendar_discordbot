132,1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.
2 Students without one of Biology 11 or Biology 12 must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 121 or BIOL 140.,3 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.
4 MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 3 credits.,5 MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 1 credit.
"6 Students lacking Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 before taking any other 100-level PHYS course, using PHYS 100 as an elective. PHYS 117 is an acceptable substitute for PHYS 101. PHYS 108 & 109 are acceptable substitutes for PHYS 118 and 119. Students are encouraged to complete this specialization requirement in their first year.","7 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Scienceâ€™s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.Any extra elective credit taken in the first, second, or third years can be applied to later elective credit requirements. See Faculty of Science Honours requirements"
"8 Students with a mark of 76% or higher in BIOL 201 or BIOC 202 may apply for admission to the Biochemistry specialization and will be allowed to use these courses in place of BIOC 203. However, BIOC 203 is the preferred route into biochemistry specializations.",9 Students with a mark of 70% or higher in BIOL 233 may use BIOL 233 in place of BIOL 234.
10 Students with CHEM 235 and a score of 76% or higher in CHEM 233 may apply for admission to this specialization and will be allowed to use CHEM 233 and 235 in place of CHEM 203.,11 All students in the Biochemistry Combined Honours specialization are required to register for the laboratory course BIOC 301 in the third year of their specialization.  Space is limited in this laboratory course.  Students who cannot take BIOC 301 in their third year must switch to another specialization.  They are not eligible to continue with a biochemistry specialization.
"12 Students may choose from either a) BIOC 449 or b) BIOC420 and ONE of BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460, or 470. Please note that BIOC 403, 440, 450, 460, or 470 cannot be double counted. If a student uses one of these courses to complete their specialization requirements, they cannot use the same course to fulfill their biochemistry research option.",
