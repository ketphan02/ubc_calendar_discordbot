120,1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.
2 Students without one of Biology 11 or Biology 12 must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 121 or BIOL 140.,3 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.
4 MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 3 credits.,5 MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives in a later year by 1 credit.
"6 Students require 3 credits of 100-level physics beyond PHYS 100. Students lacking Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 before taking any other 100-level PHYS course, using PHYS 100 as an elective. Students are encouraged to complete this specialization requirement in their first year.","7 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.Any extra elective credit taken in the first, second, or third years can be applied to later elective credit requirements. Students wishing to transfer to honours should see Faculty of Science Requirements."
"8 Students with a mark of 76% or higher in BIOL 201 or BIOC 202 may apply for admission to the Biochemistry specialization and will be allowed to use these courses in place of BIOC 203. However, BIOC 203 is the preferred route into biochemistry specializations.",
9 Students with a mark of 70% or higher in BIOL 233 may use BIOL 233 in place of BIOL 234.,10 Students with CHEM 235 and a mark of 76% or higher in CHEM 233 may apply for admission to this specialization and will be allowed to use CHEM 233 and 235 in place of CHEM 203.
,11 All students in the Biochemistry Major specialization are required to register for the laboratory course BIOC 301 in the third year of their specialization. Space is limited in this laboratory course. Students who cannot take BIOC 301 in their third year must switch to another specialization. They are not eligible to continue with a biochemistry specialization.
