High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 111. CHEM 120 and CHEM 115 may substitute for CHEM 121. CHEM 130 and CHEM 135 may substitute for CHEM 123.
"Bioinformatics or genomics electives12,15","4 While CPSC 110 is the recommended route for students pursuing a specialization in Computer Science, CPSC 103, 107 may be taken in its place using 2 credits of electives."
Electives6,5 Students pursuing a Co-op program in Computer Science are advised to also take CPSC 210 in their first year or in the summer following their first year. Co-op students will then be in a position to take one or both of CPSC 221 and CPSC 213 in term one of second year before going out on a Co-op work term.
Total Credits for Third and Fourth Years,6 Students are permitted to move elective credits between years. Students who take courses in MATH with more credits than those recommended will require fewer elective credits. Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.
Total Credits for Degree,8 CHEM 203 and 213 are also acceptable.
"1 Students without one of Biology 11 or Biology 12 must take BIOL 111 as an elective before taking BIOL 112, 121 or 140. Students without Chemistry 12 must take CHEM 100, CHEM 110, or CHEM 111 before taking BIOL 112.",
3 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.,11 We recommend that at least one of the remaining courses be taken as part of the 6 credits of CPSC courses numbered 300 or above.

"7 One of BIOL 230, BIOL 260, CHEM 235, CPSC 213, or MATH 200 can be deferred to third year.","15 Bioinformatics or genomics electives can be upper-level BIOC, BIOL, CPSC, MATH, MICB, or STAT courses, excluding Student-Directed Seminars (BIOL 490, CPSC 490). Recommended courses include BIOL 338, 430, 436, 440. Students not taking CPSC 449 must have at least 3 credits of CPSC courses 400 or above, out of the 6 credits used to satisfy this requirement."
9 BIOL 447 is required for students intending to take BIOL 449.,
10 Taken in fourth year; the thesis topic must be related to bioinformatics. Students intending to take CPSC 449 must take CPSC 349 in their third year.,
12 Every student must complete at least 3 credits from lecture based 400 level CPSC course(s).,
13 Credits gained from undergraduate Student-Directed Seminars (CPSC 490) can not be used to fulfill this requirement.,
"14 It is possible to replace some of these credits by a life science course not on this list, as long as the replacement is approved by a Biology specialization advisor.",
