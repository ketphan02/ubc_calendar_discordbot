120,1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement. ENGL 112 and SCIE 113 are recommended.  Three credits of the Communication Requirement may be deferred until second year.
,2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.
"3 Students attempting the COGS major  should choose electives to obtain prerequisites to appropriate third and fourth-year courses. Note that the B.Sc. requires at least 72 credits of science courses. Students taking more than 6 credits of first year MATH can reduce the number of elective credits required in second or third year accordingly. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits. Students are permitted to move elective credits between years.  Students who take courses in MATH, PHYS, or CHEM with more credits than those recommended can count the extra credit as electives.","4 While CPSC 110 is recommended, both of CPSC 103 and 107 may be taken in its place by using 2 credits of electives."
,5 Students without credit for Physics 12 must complete PHYS 100 in addition.
,"6 Students attempting the COGS major should complete LING 100 and PSYC 101 and 102 (or PSYC 100) as early in their program as possible. Alternatively, PSYC 101 can be taken in first year, and PSYC 102 in second year."
,7 The prerequisite PHIL 220 may be waived for PHIL 320 with the consent of the instructor.
,8 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.
,"9 Cognitive Systems module courses are recommended as electives for each year of study. Modules are sets of recommended courses that are directly relevant to Cognitive Systems. For the list of module courses, see  Cognitive Systems. Courses explicitly listed as required cannot also be counted as module courses."
"10 At least 6 credits must be PSYC module courses, and at least 6 credits must be non-PSYC module courses.",
"11 BIOL 445 and 458 can also be counted towards this requirement so long as PSYC 304, 360, 370, or 371 have not been taken.",
