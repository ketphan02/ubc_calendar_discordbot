"1 Students without Biology 11 or 12 must take BIOL 111. Applicants from other universities and colleges may substitute 6 credits of introductory biology courses for two of BIOL 111, 112, 121.",2 Applicants from other universities and colleges may substitute 3 credits of introductory chemistry that includes a lab. Students who do not have BC high school Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.
3 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement,4 Students must take one differential calculus course during first year of studies at UBC. MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit.  MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.
5 Students require 3 credits of 100-level PHYS beyond PHYS 100. Students lacking Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 in first year. Another 3 credits of PHYS may be taken at any time during the specialization but PHYS 100 must be taken during first year.,6 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Scienceâ€™s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.Note that BCIT credits include 9 UBC Arts credits and 3 credits equivalent to UBC STAT 200.
"7 Students should be aware that BIOL 140 is a prerequisite for many upper-level BIOL courses at UBC. To maintain flexibility in their ability to study at UBC, students should consider including BIOL 140 in their first year at UBC even though this course is not required in the Biotechnology specialization.",
"8 The credit for the work terms is not included in the academic credits needed for the degree or the totals for the academic year. Students must take at least one work term as either a Fall work term or a Winter work term. The remaining work term may be done as a Fall, Winter, or Summer work term. The Biotechnology specialization normally ends with a final study term.",
9 Some courses only fit particular timetables. Plan schedules to have a minimum of 15 credits in each academic term in the winter session of year four.  Students graduating in May at the end of year 5 only need to take enough academic credit to fulfill the requirements of the specialization.,
10 If more than one of these courses are taken the extra courses can count as part of the 6 credits of courses from the fourth and fifth year Biotechnology selection list.,
"11 The MICB 448 directed laboratory research project must be in the field of molecular biology. MICB 448 would normally be 3 credits. It may be taken as 6 credits if the total number of electives in fourth and fifth years is lowered from 9 credits to 6 credits, so the total required credit remains at 42 credits.",
