1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communications Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.,2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. CHEM 110 may substitute for CHEM 111.  CHEM 120 may substitute for CHEM 121.  Students interested in senior chemistry courses or who are planning to enter a career in teaching should take a second introductory chemistry course as an elective.
"3 MATH 110 is 6 credits, MATH 120, 121, 180, and 184 are 4 credits; the extra credit counts as electives so students should adjust electives accordingly.",
"4 Students who do not have B.C. High School Physics 12 (or its equivalent) must take PHYS 100 prior to other PHYS courses. Qualified students are encouraged to take PHYS (106 or 107)/108/109. Students who took PHYS 101 or 131 may enter the specialization but will need to take PHYS 106, 107, 117, or 170 before the required PHYS 216.",5 The number of elective credits in each year is chosen to make the yearly total be 30. Some course alternatives have different credit values. Students are permitted to move elective credits between years.
6 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Scienceâ€™s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.,
"7 For admission to the specialization, students must be in good standing and should be competent in MATH and PHYS.  It is advisable that a student entering any specialization in Physics or Astronomy have a minimum average of 60% in first-year PHYS and 60% in first-year MATH. See also Second Year Application, Promotion to Second Year, and Admission as a Post-Secondary Transfer.","8 Qualified students may take MATH 217 and 2 credits of electives instead of MATH 200 and MATH 317, by requesting permission to register for more than 18 credits in the term."
,9 Students with credit for MATH 152 prior to entering this specialization can substitute it for MATH 221.  MATH 221 or MATH 223 can be taken in first year.
10 Consultation with an Astronomy advisor is recommended before entering third- and fourth-year. See also Promotion Requirements and Courses Required for Promotion.,
