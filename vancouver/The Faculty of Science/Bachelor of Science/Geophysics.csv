120,1 For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement. ENGL 112 is recommended.
2 Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.,
"3 MATH 110 may substitute for the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits. For each 4 credit MATH 100-level course chosen, electives credits must be decreased by 1.",
4 Students without Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 before any other PHYS 100-level course. PHYS 100 will count as an elective. Qualified students are encouraged to take PHYS 107/108/109 or PHYS 117/118/119. Students who chose PHYS 102 must increase electives credits by 1.,5 Students who find the specific number of electives within a given year awkward to fulfill are permitted to move elective credit between years.
6 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.,
"7 Two 300-level or higher courses in thermodynamics, electromagnetism, or mechanics (solid or fluid), offered by the Faculty of Science or the Faculty of Applied Science, may satisfy these course requirements. See the geophysics undergraduate advisor for course approval.",
"8 Students are recommended to check the prerequisites for EOSC 410, and aim to satisfy these in third year.",
"9 A course in numerical analysis at the third-year level or higher, and offered by the Faculty of Science or the Faculty of Applied Science, will also satisfy this requirement. See the geophysics undergraduate advisor for course approval.",Second Year
