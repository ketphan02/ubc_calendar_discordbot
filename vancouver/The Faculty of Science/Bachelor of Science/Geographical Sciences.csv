"To ensure breadth, students must select a total of 18 credits from at least two of the following sub-disciplinary areas:","Biogeography: GEOB 302, 303, 307, 400, 407, 449, BIOL 301, 306, 402, 406, 411, 412, 413, 416 (Math 221 recommended)"
"Climatology: GEOB 300, 304, 400, 401, 402, 449, ATSC 301, 303, CHEM 302, EOSC 340 (CHEM 205 recommended)","Geographic Information Science: GEOB 370, 373, 449, one of GEOB 372, 479, 472 (CPSC 301 recommended)"
"Geomorphology: GEOB 308, 405, 406, 449, EOSC 330, 350 (EOSC 211 recommended)","Hydrology: GEOB 305, 403, 408, 449, EOSC 329, 428, 429, 430, CHEM 301, ENVR 420 (MATH 200 recommended)"
"1 To meet Geographical Sciences specialization requirements, students must complete at least 9 credits of GEOB courses during years 1 and 2, and 18 credits of GEOB courses at upper level (years 3 and 4).",2 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.
3 Students without Biology 11 or 12 must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 121.,"4 If the two-course combination of first year PHYS and CHEM courses exceeds 6 credits surplus credit may be applied to electives. Students who do not have B.C. High School Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100. PHYS chosen from 100-level PHYS courses, excluding PHYS 100. Students without Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 before taking other 100-level PHYS courses. Students may defer taking first year PHYS until second year."
5 MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.,6 MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit.
7 Students are permitted to move elective credits between years. Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Scienceâ€™s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.,8 GEOB 200 is required to complete the climatology area.
9 Select the course appropriate to one of your sub-disciplinary areas of interest.,10 CPSC 301 can only be taken by students with third-year standing.
11 See list of selections in sub-disciplinary areas of Geographical Sciences at the start of the footnotes.,12 Field Course must be taken in May preceding fourth year; extra fee to be paid.
13 Students interested in pursuing registration as a Professional Geoscientist in Environmental Geoscience with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (APEGBC) should consult the Geography Department science advisor and select their electives accordingly. Students are also encouraged to consider Environmental Geoscience-related courses in other Departments or a minor in a specialization in Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS). Please see the Field of Geography.,
