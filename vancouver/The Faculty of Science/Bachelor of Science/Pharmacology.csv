120,1 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communication Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.
2  Students without one of Biology 11 or Biology 12 must take BIOL 111 before taking BIOL 112 or BIOL 121. Students without Chemistry 12 must take CHEM 100 or CHEM 111 before taking BIOL 112.,3 Students who do not have BC high school Chemistry 12 (or its equivalent) must write the UBC Chemistry Basic Skills Test and may be required to take CHEM 100.
,"4 MATH 110, 120, 180 or 184 may substitute for any of the specified calculus courses. The extra credit for these courses with more than 3 credits would count as part of the elective credit in later years."
5 MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses.,"6 Students lacking PHYS 12 must take PHYS 100 before taking PHYS 101, 107 or 117."
7 The combination of CHEM 203 and 213 are accepted as a substitute for CHEM 233 and 235 if students have credit for CHEM 203 and 213.,8 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.
9 Must be taken in third year.,10 BIOC 303 is also acceptable. The extra credits for BIOC 303 instead of BIOC 302 would count as an elective.
