1 LFS 150 recommended.,
"2 Students without credit for Biology 12 must take BIOL 111, which can be counted as an Unrestricted Elective.",
"3 Students may substitute MATH 100, 102 or 110 for MATH 104, and MATH 101 or 103 for MATH 105. Students who have not completed Calculus 12 should take MATH 184 as a substitute for MATH 104.",
"4 It is recommended that students take a minimum of 6 credits of 100, 200 level courses that contribute toward interdisciplinary breadth. This includes courses in science (e.g., biology), geography, sociology, psychology and political science.",
"5 STAT 200, BIOL 300, FRST 231 or ECON 325 can be substituted for LFS 252.",
"6 Students must complete their first year MATH requirement before taking ECON 301, 302 and 303, and must take ECON 301 and other prerequisites before taking 400 level ECON courses.",
"7 Choose from FRE 302, 340, 374, 420, 460, 474 and 490. Recommended: FRE 340, 460 and 474 (Food Markets and Development); FRE 374, 420 and 474 (Land, Resources & Environment); and FRE 302 and either FRE 460 or FRE 420 (Food and Resource Management).",

"9 Choose any eligible 300 or 400 level course in COMR, ECON and FRE. Students with a strong interest in research should take FRST 399 and consider having a FRE faculty member supervise a directed studies course (FRE 497) and/or a 6 credit thesis (FRE 499).",
