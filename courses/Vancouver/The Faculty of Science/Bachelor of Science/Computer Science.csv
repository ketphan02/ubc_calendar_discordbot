9,"4 Students attempting the COGS major should choose electives to obtain prerequisites to appropriate third- and fourth-year courses. Note that the B.Sc. requires at least 72 credits of science courses. Students taking more than 6 credits of first-year MATH can reduce the number of elective credits required in first, second or third year accordingly. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits. Students are permitted to move elective credits between years."
3,"6 Prerequisites for Cognitive Systems module courses are recommended as electives for each year of study. Modules are sets of recommended courses that are directly relevant to Cognitive Systems. For the list of module courses, see Cognitive Systems program website. Courses explicitly listed as required cannot also be credited as module courses."
3,"8 Students should take LING 100 as soon as possible, preferably before taking COGS 200."
12,"10 Students must achieve a grade of greater than 72% in this course, or else must take another 3 credits of MATH or STAT in order to be admitted to CPSC 320. Students interested in further STAT courses are recommended to take STAT 200."
20,12 BIOL 455 and 458 can also be counted towards this requirement so long as PSYC 360 or PSYC 304 has not been taken.

"2 While CPSC 110 is the recommended route for students pursuing a program in Computer Science, CPSC 103, 107 may be taken in its place using 2 credits of electives.",
3 Students pursuing a Co-op option are advised to also take CPSC 210 in their first year or in the summer following their first year. Co-op students will then be in a position to take CPSC 221 in Term 1 of second year before going out on a Co-op work term.,
5 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.,
"7 Students who are thinking of taking BIOL courses as Cognitive Systems module courses will need BIOL 361, and hence should plan on taking BIOL 112, CHEM 111 or 121, CHEM 123 and BIOL 200 in first and second year.",
9 The prerequisite PHIL 220 may be waived for PHIL 320 with the consent of the instructor.,
11 At least 3 credits must be 400-level CPSC module courses and 9 credits must be non-CPSC module courses.,
