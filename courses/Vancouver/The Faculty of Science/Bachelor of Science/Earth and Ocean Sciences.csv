The requirement for these courses may be waived if a student has completed upper-level courses in each of the solid and fluid earth sciences.
4 MATH 180 or 184 or 120 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit. MATH 110 may substitute for any of the specified differential calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 3 credits.,5 MATH 121 may substitute for any of the specified integral calculus courses listed by decreasing the electives by 1 credit.
,"6 Chosen from 100-level PHYS courses, excluding PHYS 100. Students without Physics 12 must take PHYS 100 before taking any other 100-level PHYS course. PHYS 100 will count as an elective. Qualified students are encouraged to take PHYS 117 or PHYS 107."
,7 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Scienceâ€™s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements.
,8 Six credits may be delayed to third year if 300-level or higher courses are used for this requirement. See advisor.
"9 A maximum of 6 credits may be replaced by credits from (BIOL 306, CHEM 301, 302, GEOB 300, or 304).",
