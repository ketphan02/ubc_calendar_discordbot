2 A total of 6 credits of coursework is required to meet the Communications Requirement. For a full list of acceptable courses see Communication Requirement.,7 The number of elective credits in each year is chosen to make the yearly total be 33. Some course alternatives have different credit values. Students are permitted to move elective credits between years.

,"10 Students who are interested in mathematical physics are advised to substitute MATH 226, 227 for MATH 217. MATH 200, 317 can also be substituted for MATH 217. Either substitution would require using 2 credits of science elective.   They are also encouraged to take MATH 320, 321 later in their program."
6 Other subject credits must be chosen in consultation with the advisor from the other department.,"11 Consultation with an advisor in both departments is recommended before entering third- and fourth-year. See also Introduction to Degree Options, Promotion Requirements and Courses Required for Promotion."
"8 Elective credits together with required courses must fulfill the Faculty of Science’s: a) Foundational Requirement; b) Laboratory Science Requirement; c) Science Breadth Requirement;  d) Science and Arts Requirements;  e) Upper-level Requirement;  f) General Degree Requirements. Honours specializations have additional requirements, see Introduction to Degree Options.","12 PHYS 401 is 3 credits, PHYS 408 is 4 credits; students should adjust elective credits accordingly."
"9 For admission to the specialization, students must be in good standing with no courses failed and a grade of at least 68% in each first-year physics and mathematics course. See also Introduction to Degree Options, Second Year Application, Promotion to Second Year, and Admission as a Post-Secondary Transfer.",13 If the honours thesis (449) is chosen from the other discipline replace PHYS 449(6) by PHYS 409(3) and adjust electives accordingly.
