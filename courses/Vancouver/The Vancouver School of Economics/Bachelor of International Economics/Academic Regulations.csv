* Students required to discontinue from the B.I.E. may transfer into the B.A. Program in the Faculty of Arts. Students required to withdraw are not eligible for the B.A. and must withdraw from the University,"1 Core average is computed on the following required Core courses: MATH 104/184, MATH 105; ECON 101, 102, 255, 309, 315, 316, 317, 327, 328; COEC 293; and WRDS 150 (or equivalents to any of these). The calculation of the Core average will include any and all of these courses if they were taken in the Winter Session under evaluation. Core courses completed in prior Sessions are not included in subsequent calculations."
"2 Note that, if any of MATH 104/184 and/or MATH 105 (or equivalents), ECON 101 and/or ECON 102 are attempted in the Session, students must achieve a passing grade in the course(s) in addition to maintaining their Core Average. A student who fails any of these courses will be required to discontinue from the B.I.E.",
